I am a *Data Scientist* and *Computer Scientist* interested in applying *machine learning* to real world examples, I also like to contribute to *Open Source*. Below is a list of projects I have done that I think are interesting.

Right now I am searching for *new job opportunities* in the Academic world (To get a PhD on Machine Learning) or in anything related to Machine Learning or Big Data.

* Personal projects
** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/DPASF][DPASF (Data Pre-processing Algorithms for Streaming in Flink)]]
   This is my MSc on Data Science final project. This is a library for Data Pre-processing Algorithms for Streaming in Flink (DPASF). It has an associated publication (currently a pre-print on [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06021][ArXiv]]).

** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory][Scala-Category-Theory]]

** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/hugo_similar_posts][Hugo Similar Posts]]
   Computing similar posts for my blog using Sklearn Kmeans, you can read more about this project in the blog post: [[https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/related-posts-hugo-sklearn/][Show related posts in Hugo with Sklearn]].

** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/NLP_Dependency_Parsing][NLP Dependency Parsing for Spanish]]
   Final project of my Computer Science degree. This software is an implementation of a Dependency parser for Spanish, using SVMs.

** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/myDWM][My Personal DWM fork]]
   Personal Fork of DWM, It has two branches, master that is as the original dwm and has a simple status color patch, and myconfig, that as its name point, is my personal config of DWM.

** [[https://github.com/elbaulp/genPlaylistByName][Generate Playlist By Length]]
   A little python script for generate playlist with a given length in minutes. You can read more about this in the post [[https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/generar-listas-de-reproduccion-determinada-duracion-python/][/Create music playlists with a given length/]]

* Hobbies
  As for my hobbies, I like to lift heavy things, hiking and spend time on nature.
