* Quick reference guide for emacs Org-mode key binds
This is a quick reference to org mode, it is mostly a copy and paste from its manual, but I needed an easy way of checking the most useful *org-mode commands* in a single view, because I found myself checking again and again its manual.

First, you can cycle through your sections with =<TAB>=, which *expands/contract* sections in your document.

* Sections
#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    some text
*** 3rd level
    more text

* Another top level headline
#+END_SRC

* Cycling
You can cycle through sections with:

- =<TAB>=  Cycle *sub-tree*.
- =S-<TAB>= or =C-u <TAB>= *Global* cycle. (The entire buffer)
- =C-u C-u C-u <TAB>= Show all.

* Move through headlines
- =C-c C-n= Next heading.
- =C-c C-p= Previous heading.
- =C-c C-f= Next heading same level.
- =C-c C-b= Previous heading same level.
- =C-c C-u= Backward to higher level heading.

<!--more--><!--ad-->

* Insert/modify sections
- =M-<RET>= Insert new heading with same level as current. If the cursor is at a plain list item, a new item is created. If used in the middle of a line, split the line and the rest become a new headline.
- =M-S-<RET>= Insert new TODO at *same level*.
- =<TAB>= In a new empty entry cycle through levels.
- =M-<left>/<right>= Promote/demote *current headline* by one level.
- =M-S-<left>/<right>= Promote/demote the *current sub-tree* by one level.
- =M-S-<up>/<down>=  Move *sub-tree* up/down (swap with previous/next sub-tree of same level).
- =C-c C-w= Refile *entry or region* to a different location.
- =C-x n s/w=  Narrow buffer to *current sub-tree* / widen it again

* Sparse Trees
Useful to hide documents parts where you are not currently working.

- =C-c <forward slash>= Prompts to create a sparse-tree
- =C-c <forward slash> r= Occur. Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches. Each match is also highlighted; the highlights disappear by pressing C-c C-c.

* Plain lists
- /Unordered:/ =-=, =+= or =*=.
- /Ordered:/ =1.= or =1)=
- /Description:/ Use =::= to separate the /term/ from the /description/.
- =<TAB>= Fold items.
- =M-<RET>= Insert item at the same level.
- =M-S-<RET>= Insert item with a Checkbox.
- =M-S-<up>/<down>= Move items *including sub-items* up/down.
- =M-<left>/M-<right>= Decrease/increase indentation level.
- =M-S-<left>/<right>= Decrease/increase indentation level, including *sub-items*.
- =C-c C-c= If there is a *checkbox*, toggle it.
- =C-c -= Cycle through differences kinds of lists.

* Footnotes
- =C-c C-x f= When cursor is at a footnote reference, jump to definition. When at a definition, jump to first reference. Otherwise, create a new footnote.
- =C-c C-c= Jump between definition and reference.

Here is an example footnote [fn:1]. The code to generate it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
Here is an example footnote [fn:1].

[fn:1] Click return to return to reference
#+END_SRC

[fn:1] Click to return to reference

* Hyperlinks
Syntax: =[[link][description]]= or only =[[link]]=, once a link is created, you can edit it with =C-c C-l=

In case the link is not a URL, it is considered to be internal in the current file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
[[#custom-id]]
[[My Target][Find my target]]
#+END_SRC

The last one will search for a target in the current file with syntax =<<My Target>>=

- =C-c l= Store a link to the current location.
- =C-c C-l= Insert link, it will ask you for the link and an optional description. If called with =C-u= prefix, file name completion is used to link to a file.
- =C-c C-l= with *cursor in a link*, allows to edit it.
- =C-c C-o= or =mouse-1= or =mouse-2= open link.

* TODO items
Any headline starting with /TODO/ becomes a /TODO/ item.

- =C-c C-t= Rotate the TODO state of the current item among /(unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE -> (unmarked)/
- =S-<right>/<left>= As above, but *only for the item* at point.
- =C-c / t= View /TODO/ items in a /sparse tree/.
- =C-c a t= Show the global TODO list.
- =S-M-<RET>= Insert new /TODO/ item.
- C-c , Set priority for item (Between /A,B,C/).
- =S-<up>/<dwn>= Cycle through priorities.

** TODO checkboxes
You can have a composed list of /TODO/ items, and can toggle it with =C-c C-c=, and create a new one with =M-S-<RET>=.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* TODO Organize party [0/3]
  - [ ] call people [0/2]
    - [ ] Peter
    - [ ] Sarah
  - [ ] order food
#+END_SRC

- =*bold*= => *bold*.
- =/italics/= => /italics/.
- ==code== and =~verbatim~= ->  =code=, ~verbatim~.

* Images & Tables
Tables have this syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
| HEADER1  | header2  |
|----------+----------|
| content1 | contend2 |
#+END_SRC

* Source code
To include source code:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
 #+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

will render to
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-xor (a b)
  "Exclusive or."
  (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC

You can edit the code example in a buffer supporting that language with =C-c '=
