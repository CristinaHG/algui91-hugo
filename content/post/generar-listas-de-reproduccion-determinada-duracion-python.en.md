title: "Create music playlists with a given length"
---

Many of us like to listen to music while programming. Today I thought that it would be nice if I could create a playlist with a fixed length I can choose.

After a little thinking I decided to write a little [python](https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/tags/python "posts about python") script that do the work for me. It accepts as params a directory where the music is, and the duration for the playlist.

# Requirements

In order to read the length of each file I've used <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mutagen/" title="Mutagen Homepage" target="_blank">Mutagen</a>. It is easy to install:

```bash
$ pip install mutagen
```

Once installed, we can execute the script, here is the code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Creating playlists

Its use is simple:

```bash
$ ./genPlayListByLength.py -h
usage: genPlayListByLength.py [-h] -d DIRECTORY -l LENGTH

Generate playlists with the indicated length

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        Directory with music files
  -l LENGTH, --length LENGTH
                        Length of the playlist, in minutes

```

The script will create as many playlists of the given length as it can, 32 above.

# Improvements

It took me half an hour to write the script, so it can greatly be improved. Right now it only looks music files in the current directory, not recursively.
