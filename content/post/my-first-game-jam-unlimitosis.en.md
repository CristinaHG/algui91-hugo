Some weeks ago I participated in my first __GameJam__. I've never program a Game so this was a challenge for me. We have 48 hours to think and develop a Game from scratch. Our team decided to use __Godot__ engine. The team was formed by four people: [@Cristina](/en/author/cristina/), <a href="http://elenoideart.deviantart.com/" target="_blank" title="@ElenoideArt">@ElenoideArt</a>, @JJ Ramos and me.

@Elenoide was our game designer and it is also a __biologist__, so we thought a game in which cells pops ups in the screen and eventually become _Carcinogens_, the player has to kill those cells before they spread. Here is a screen record:

As you can see, the game is very basic, but hey, none of us knew how to create a game the day before. If you want to improve it, prove it or play it, the code is in <a href="https://github.com/elbaulp/GranadaGameJam17" target="_blank" title="Unlimitosis Repo">Unlimitosis Repo</a>.

# Documentation

In order to learn _Godot_ we use its documentation, it is very well explained and extense. Also, there is a <a href="https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/TD-Godot-Games" target="_blank" title="TutorialDoctor">github repo with a lot of examples</a>

# Play the Game

Thanks to __JJ Ramos__ we have a web version for the game at <a href="http://juanjoseramos.com/unlimitosis/" target="_blank" title="http://juanjoseramos.com/unlimitosis/">juanjoseramos.com/unlimitosis/</a>
