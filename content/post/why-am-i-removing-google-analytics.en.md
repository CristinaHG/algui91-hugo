As I am more concerned about my privacy on the internet as time goes by, I feel morally obligated to the the same for my readers, that is why I am removing all stuff that can be used to track my users on the internet.

The first step is to remove **Google Analytics** due to its tracking nature. This is a big sacifice for my since I won't be able to see any statistics about how the blog is performing anymore.

There is still work to be done, I only have **one ad** and it will continue there until I can figure out an alternative which give me similar revenue. I hope you can understand this decision, since managing and writing a blog is time consuming and this is a way of compensate all that work. I have some alternatives to the ad, but none of them have work so far. You can check them in [/en/apoyanos/](https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/apoyanos/ ""). Here are a few of them:

Hope you like the change!
